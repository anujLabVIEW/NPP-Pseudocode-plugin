Pseudocode plug-in for Notepad++

Notepad++ is a text editor and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window. The project's name comes from the C increment operator. Notepad++ is distributed as free software.
Notepad++ makes it possible to define "languages", or more precisely, highlighting schemes (UDLs). This pseudocode plug-in is a custom-defined-language that provides syntax highlighting. It has been built for the Computer Science syllabuses of Cambridge International Assessment Education, specifically for the following.

    [2017-2020] Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science 9608
    [2017-2019] Cambridge IGCSE Computer Science 0478

### Dark themes
You will need to install a dark theme to Notepad++ if you want to use the dark theme provided with this extension (Pseudocode Dark Add-in.xml). You can either use the dark theme (Dark theme.xml) that ships with this extension, or use another one of your choice (Npp-1-Dark at URL https://github.com/60ss/Npp-1-Dark.git by 60ss is a great theme).
The official page at https://npp-user-manual.org/docs/themes/ explains clearly how to install themes.
NOTE: The dark theme Pseudocode file is not currently updated to match the last updated normal (white) theme.
